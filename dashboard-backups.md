# Backups
{: #dashboard-backups}

You can create and download backups from the _Backups_ tab of the _Manage_ page of your service dashboard. Daily, weekly, monthly, and on-demand backups are available. They are retained according to the following schedule:

Backup type|Retention schedule
----------|-----------
Daily|Daily backups are retained for 7 days
Weekly|Weekly backups are retained for 4 weeks
Monthly|Monthly backups are retained for 3 months
On-demand|One on-demand backup is retained. The retained backup is always the most recent on-demand backup.

Backup schedules and retention policies are fixed. If you need to keep more backups than the retention schedule allows, you should download backups and retain archives according to your business requirements.

## Viewing existing backups

Daily backups of your database are automatically scheduled. To view your existing backups

1. Navigate to the _Manage_ page of your service Dashboard.
2. Click **Backups** in the tabs to open the _Backups_ page. A list of available backups is shown, with the most recent backups at the top of the list:

  ![Available backups](./images/janusgraph-backups-show.png "A list of available backups, including a pending backup")

Click the corresponding row to expand the options for any available backup.
  ![Backup Options](./images/janusgraph-backups-options.png "Options for a backup.") 

### Using the API to view existing backups

A list of backups is available at the `GET /2016-07/deployments/:id/backups` endpoint. The Foundation Endpoint with the service instance ID and the deployment ID are both shown in the service's _Overview_. For example,
``` 
https://composebroker-dashboard-public.mybluemix.net/api/2016-07/instances/$INSTANCE_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID/backups
```  

## Creating a manual backup

As well as scheduled backups you can create a backup manually. To create a manual backup, follow the steps to view existing backups, then click **Back up now**. A message is displayed indicating that a backup has been initiated, and a 'pending' backup is added to the list of available backups.

### Using the API to create a backup

Send a POST request to the backups endpoint to initiate a manual back up: `POST /2016-07/deployments/:id/backups`. It returns immediately with the recipe ID and information about the backup as it is running. You have to check the backups endpoint to see whether the backup finished and find its backup_id before you can use it. Use `GET /2016-07/deployments/:id/backups/`.

## Restoring a backup

To restore a backup to a new service instance, follow the steps to view existing backups, then click in the corresponding row to expand the options for the backup you want to download. Click the **Restore** button. A message is displayed saying that a restore has been initiated. The new service instance is automatically named "janusgraph-restore-[timestamp]", and appears on your dashboard when provisioning starts.

### Restoring via the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI

Use the following steps to restore a backup from a running JanusGraph service to a new JanusGraph service by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI. 
1. If you need to, [download and install it](/docs/cli/reference/ibmcloud?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started). 
2. Find the backup that you would like to restore from on the _Backups_ page on your service and copy the backup ID.  
  **Or**  
  Use the `GET /2016-07/deployments/:id/backups` to find a backup and its ID through the Compose API. The Foundation Endpoint and the service instance ID are both shown in the service's _Overview_. For example, 
  ``` 
  https://composebroker-dashboard-public.mybluemix.net/api/2016-07/instances/$INSTANCE_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID/backups
  ```  
  The response contains a list of all available backups for that service instance. Pick the backup that you would like to restore from and copy its ID.

3. Log in with the appropriate account and credentials. `ibmcloud login` (or `ibmcloud login -help` to see all the login options).

4. Switch to your Organization and Space `ibmcloud target -o "$YOUR_ORG" -s "YOUR_SPACE"`

5. Use the `service create` command to provision a new service, and provide the source service and the specific backup that you are restoring in a JSON object. For example:
```
ibmcloud service create SERVICE PLAN SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME -c '{"source_service_instance_id": "$SERVICE_INSTANCE_ID", "backup_id": "$BACKUP_ID" }'
```
  For _SERVICE_ use the value `compose-for-janusgraph`, for _PLAN_ use either Standard or Enterprise depending on your environment. _SERVICE\_INSTANCE\_NAME_ is where you put the name for your new service. The _source\_service\_instance\_id_ is the service instance ID of the source of the backup; it can be obtained by running `ibmcloud cf service DISPLAY_NAME --guid` where _DISPLAY\_NAME_ is the name of the JanusGraph service the backup is from. 
  
  If you are an Enterprise user, you also need to specify which cluster to deploy to in the JSON object with the `"cluster_id": "$CLUSTER_ID"` parameter.
  
### Upgrading to a new version

Some major version upgrades are not available in the current running deployment. You need to provision a new service that is running the upgraded version, and then migrate your data into it using a backup. This process is the same a restoring a backup, except here you specify the version that you want to upgrade to.
``` 
ibmcloud service create SERVICE PLAN SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME -c '{"source_service_instance_id": "$SERVICE_INSTANCE_ID", "backup_id": ""$BACKUP_ID", "db_version":"$VERSION_NUMBER" }'
```

For example, to restore an older version of a {{site.data.keyword.composeForJanusGraph}} service to a new service running JanusGraph 0.1.1, use
```
ibmcloud service create compose-for-janusgraph Standard migrated_janusgraph -c '{ "source_service_instance_id": "0269e284-dcac-4618-89a7-f79e3f1cea6a", "backup_id":"5a96d8a7e16c090018884566", "db_version":"0.1.1"  }'
